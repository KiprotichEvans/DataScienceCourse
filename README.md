# Data Science Course Assignments

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Data Science course assignments. This repository will be updated with assignments and projects throughout the course. Each week will focus on different aspects of data science, including data manipulation, analysis, machine learning, and more.

## Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week containing its own set of assignments and resources:

- `week1/` - Assignments for Week 1
  - `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with Python solutions.
  - `sql_queries/` - SQL scripts for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
  - `data/` - Datasets used in Week 1 assignments.
- `week2/` - Assignments for Week 2 (To be added)
- `week3/` - Assignments for Week 3 (To be added)
- ... (and so on)

## Week 1 Assignments

### Overview

The Week 1 assignments focus on data manipulation and analysis using Python and SQL. The tasks include filtering records, calculating statistical measures, and performing data cleaning.

### Contents

#### Notebooks

- `Week1_Assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with Python code to answer the assignment questions. This notebook includes:
  - Loading and exploring the dataset.
  - Filtering records based on specific conditions.
  - Calculating statistical measures such as mean values.
  - Data cleaning tasks such as renaming columns and checking for NULL values.

#### SQL Queries

- `week1_queries.sql`: SQL script with queries to perform data analysis and manipulation tasks. This script includes:
  - Counting records based on conditions.
  - Calculating mean values grouped by weather conditions.
  - Filtering records with specific conditions.
  - Counting weather conditions that include specific terms.

#### Data

- `1. Weather Data.csv`: Dataset used for the Week 1 assignments. Ensure this file is placed in the appropriate directory for the notebooks and SQL scripts to access it.

## Instructions

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `Weather.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the cells to execute the Python code and see the results.

2. **SQL Queries**:
   - Open `Week1 SQL.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any other SQL client.
   - Execute the queries to see the results.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed for running the Jupyter notebooks:

- pandas
- numpy

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## Future Assignments

This repository will be updated with new assignments and projects as the course progresses. Each new week will have its own directory and set of instructions.
